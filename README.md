## Intended Use and Scope

World Explorer 3D is currently presented as an exploratory driving experience, but the engine is designed to support broader applications, including:

- Urban visualization and digital twins
- Educational geography tools
- Simulation and navigation research
- Real estate and neighborhood exploration
- Drone path planning and aerial inspection tools
- Interactive data overlays for city-scale datasets

---

## Future Directions

Planned and potential extensions include:

- Modular engine separation (engine vs. demo layer)
- Traffic and multi-agent simulation
- Pedestrian and non-vehicle navigation modes
- Day/night and weather systems
- Data layer overlays (zoning, demographics, infrastructure)
- VR and immersive display support
- Multi-user synchronized exploration

These directions are exploratory and subject to change.
